# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

This repository contains various implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms written in Dart. It is organized into the following sections:

---

## 📚 Algorithms

- **Huffman Coding**  
  Implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm. Includes encoding and decoding functionality.

---

## 🔗 Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked List**  
  Basic operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, searching ...

- **Doubly Linked List**  
  Supports bidirectional traversal, insertion, deletion ...

- **Circular Linked List**  
  A singly linked list where the last node points back to the head. Includes insertAtEnd, insertAtFirst ...

---

## 🗺️ Map Utilities

This section contains various map-based utility functions:

- `countOccurrences` – Counts the number of times each element appears in a list.
- `filterMapByValue` – Filters a map by a value threshold.
- `mergeMaps` – Merges two maps by summing values of common keys.
- `invertMap` – Swaps keys and values.
- `findKeyWithMaximumValue` – Finds the key associated with the highest value.
- `sortMapKeys` – Sorts map keys in ascending order.
- `groupStringsByTheirFirstCharacter` – Groups strings based on their starting character.

---

## 🧮 Queue

- **Linked Queue**  
  A queue implemented using linked list nodes, supporting `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `peek`, and `isEmpty`.

- **List Queue**  
  A queue using List with full method support similar to the linked queue.

---

## 🧱 Stack

- **Stack Using Linked List**  
  Implementation of a stack using a singly linked list. Supports all core stack operations: `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `isEmpty`.

---

## 💡 Problem Solving

### 1. String Problems

- **Anagrams**  
  Checks whether two strings are anagrams of each other.

- **Substring Search**  
  Finds whether a substring exists within a larger string and returns its index.

### 2. Ring Buffer

- **Ring Buffer (Circular Buffer)**  
  Efficient fixed-size buffer using a circular structure. Supports add, get, and buffer full/empty detection.
